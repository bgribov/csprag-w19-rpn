## Question 2
``` 2
I think my experience thus far has more aligned with "unix culture". Throughout my classes I have learned more how to code so that other coders can look through my code when working in group projects in EECS 183, and 280. I haven't yet programmed anything that would involve other people to be using something I coded, and therefore haven't really focused on making a GUI interface. However, I feel like once I started making programs that other users will use, I would become more of a "Windows culture" programmer as it seems more reasonable to me to make code that is easily used for those that will use it more frequently, and if that is non-coders than the code should be conducive to that.

## Question 3

What both these articles made me think is that it's incredibly important to know how to use your command line and use all the "bullshittery" that comes with it to not get bogged down in it. The first article especially spoke about how it isn't the intellectual part of programming and that students get stuck on it so often that it's important to know how to use it to quickly get around it instead of getting stuck on it since it is not the important part of research and Computer Science. The second article really focused on how it's important to learn the skills from learning the command line "bullshittery" because if just taught in class the students will never know how to teach themselves and learn what they need to know by themselves. I completely agree as I know that I get incredibly stuck using my command line and git a lot and that is exactly why I took this class to know where to look and gain the experience to always be able to quickly figure out how to use my command line and the programs I need to actually do my coding.
